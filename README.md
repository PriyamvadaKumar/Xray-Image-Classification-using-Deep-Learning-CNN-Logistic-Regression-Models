# Xray-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-CNN-Logistic-Regression-Models
Convolutional Neural network and Logistic Regression multi-class models that can diagnose Pneumonia and COVID-19 from Xray images with 86% accuracy



# Project

Multiclass X-Ray classification to detect Pneumonia, Covid-19 and healthy patients using Convolution Neural Network and a Logistic Regression Model.






The models were evaluated on the basis of accuracy , precision and recall and a confusion matrix
